# mattdav.is

This is the code for my personal website located at [https://mattdav.is](https://mattdav.is).
It uses the open source project [EXIF Photo Blog](https://github.com/sambecker/exif-photo-blog)
by Sam Becker as its foundation. Credit goes to Sam for creating the original codebase.

The site showcases my photography, projects and writing.
